**Recommendation for Textbooks**

([Previous Page](ds-and-algorithms.md))

Here is a list of textbooks I had been using in my undergraduate Computer Science program. Some of them are ancient (published in 1980 or so) but are still useful.

Books that are programming languages specified:
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) - in Lisp
* Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich
* Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++ by Mark A. Weiss
* Algorithms in a Nutshell: A Practical Guide - in Java and Python
* Algorithms, 4th Edition - in Java

Books that use pseudo codes or natural languages:
* Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition | The MIT Press
* Data Structures and Algorithms by Alfred V. Aho
* Algorithms Unlocked | The MIT Press

For people who would like to improve their coding style in Python, here are books that I believe you have been looking for:
* Python Cookbook 3rd Edition
* Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python by Rance D. Necaise

Python Cookbook is the best reference to demonstrate "how to avoid programming like a novice": closures, descriptors, containers, decorators, context managers, coroutines, lazy properties, attrgetter, itemgetter, and so on.

Python has many advanced features that can make object-oriented programming much more comfortable, manageable, and straightforward. Most people do not even know them, sadly. These features can help you improve your developing efficiency dramatically, although they are not in any way associated with execution efficiency.

Necaise is the best introductory-level guidance for abstract data types (ADT). Topics like the following can be found in this book:
* What is the definition of "average probing length" by Donald Knuth?
* When do primary and secondary clusterings happen in a hash mapping operation?
* List several ways of computing amortized cost (answer: aggregate method, bankers' method, physicists' method).
* How to merge two binary heaps in linear time? - my favorite question!

The preceding are fundamental questions in IT companies' job interviews.

Of course, a real job interview will be much more stringent than these.

Good luck with your applications!
